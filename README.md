# Xenorig Project
***This miner is inspired by [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) and thus the similarity in UI design. The codes are 100% original.***

Xenorig is a high performance Xenorig (XENOP) miner, with official support for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Originally based on [Xenophyte-Solo-Miner](https://github.com/Xenophyte-coin/Xenophyte-Solo-Miner) with heavy optimizations/rewrites.

## Features
- High performance thanks to Microsoft Native AOT.
- Official support for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. (Includes Raspberry PI as well)
- Support for backup (failover) mining server.
- It's open source software.

## Downloads
- Binary releases: https://github.com/TheDialgaTeam/Xenorig/releases

## Other information
- Donation is optional but I do appreciate at least 1% for the effort.

### CPU mining performance
Please note performance is highly dependent on system load. Tasks heavily using a processor, such as video playback, can greatly degrade hashrate. Optimal number of threads depends on the number of cores you have on your hardware.

### Maximum performance checklist
- Idle operating system.
- Do not exceed optimal thread count.
- Try setup optimal thread affinity.
