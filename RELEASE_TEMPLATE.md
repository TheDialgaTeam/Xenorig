Change Logs from v1.0.0.28:

Note:
- Windows (x64, x86, ARM32, ARM64), Linux (x64, ARM32, ARM64), and MacOS (x64) have been prebuilt with the [xirorig_native](https://github.com/TheDialgaTeam/Xirorig/tree/xirorig_future/Xirorig.Native/xirorig_native) library. If they crash Xirorig, most likely they are incompatible and require you to manually build them. Instructions to build [xirorig_native](https://github.com/TheDialgaTeam/Xirorig/tree/xirorig_future/Xirorig.Native/xirorig_native) is included in the [README.md](https://github.com/TheDialgaTeam/Xirorig/blob/xirorig_future/README.md).

- Without [xirorig_native](https://github.com/TheDialgaTeam/Xirorig/tree/xirorig_future/Xirorig.Native/xirorig_native) library, the miner will fall back to software mode, which will have slower hashing speed.

For Linux and MacOS user: You can use `tar -xf x64-linux.tar.gz` or `tar -xf x64-osx.tar.gz` to unzip, which would also set the permission for execute correctly.

To run the application, simply use ./Xirorig or double-click on the executable on windows to run the application.
